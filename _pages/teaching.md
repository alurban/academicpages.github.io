Below is a list of courses I have taught and projects I have mentored undergraduates on. This list is indexed based on institution; see my [CV](http://alurban.github.io/cv/) for more information.

## Caltech

### Undergraduate mentoring

* Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellows (SURFs), 2017-2018
  * Using machine learning to improve LIGO data quality
  * Modeling of kilonova light curves to improve parameter estimation
  * Next-generation LIGO designs and identifying statistical and systematic uncertainties from detector calibration that affect cosmography measurements
  * Constraining binary black hole merger scenarios that predict optical, X-ray, or *γ*-ray counterparts
* Independent Study, 2016-2017
  * Topics included radiation of gravitational waves; tidal deformation; equation of state models for white dwarfs and neutron stars; the compact object mass–radius relationship; the Chandrasekhar mass limit for white dwarfs; mass and spin constraints from electromagnetic counterparts of black hole–neutron star mergers

### Courses

* Caltech LIGO SURF training, 2017-2018
  * Series of lectures designed to introduce 20 undergraduate researchers to gravitational wave astronomy
  * Topics included an overview of the LIGO detectors; an introduction to signal processing, including Fourier analysis and power spectral densities; and multimessenger astronomy using GW150914
* Guest lecturer: Vibrations and Waves, 2017
  * Topics included dispersion, dispersion relations, musical instruments, sympathetic resonance, Fourier series, and Chladni waves

## University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee

### Undergraduate mentoring

* Student researcher, 2015-2016
  * Design and test software to cross-reference known *γ*-ray sources against LIGO data

### Courses

* Physics I: Mechanics (lab component), 2010-2014
  * Lab component to a standard first-semester intro course for physics majors
  * Gave input to syllabus design
* Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism (lab component), 2011-2015
  * Lab component to a standard second-semester intro course for physics majors
* Physics for Everyday Life (lab component), 2015
  * Intro level lab-based approach for non majors that relies on students’ daily experience
* Guest lecturer: Gravitation, 2012
  * Advanced graduate-level course on general relativity
  * Topics included black hole dynamics and interiors, the focal point of my research at the time
