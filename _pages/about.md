I am currently a **Research Associate** in the **Department of Physics and Astronomy**
at **Louisiana State University**. I am also affiliated with
[**LIGO Livingston Observatory**](http://ligo.caltech.edu/LA).

I am primarily a computing support specialist and data analyst for the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). I assist with and provide support for the detector
characterization effort, which seeks to improve LIGO data quality and sensitivity by understanding
environmental noise sources and detector behavior. In the past my research activities have focused
on calibration of the LIGO detectors, compact binary astrophysics, and joint observations of
neutron star mergers using LIGO and more traditional telescopes around the world.

teaching and mentoring experience, research interests, selected scientific publications, talks and
presentations, and a set of tutorials for students and scientists new to LIGO. Finally, the last
